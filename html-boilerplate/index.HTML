    <h1>Pennsylvania Senate race: Will Fetterman's debate struggles actually matter?</h1>

    <p><strong>Democrat John Fetterman hoped to demonstrate that a stroke he suffered in May would not adversely affect his ability to hold public office. 
        A halting, tentative debate performance, however, has raised more questions about whether he is fit to serve in the US Senate.</strong></p>

        <p>The crowd of Fetterman supporters gathered to watch the debate at the Square Cafe in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night were ready for a party. 
            The City Paper, a local weekly newspaper, organised the event, which included a politics trivia contest and debate bingo cards with words and phrases that might come up during the one-hour candidate face-off - words like "abortion," "inflation" and "crime".</p>
        
            <!--The em makes my texts italic. It stands for emphasis-->

        <p><em>It turns out, however, that another bingo square, <strong>"Fetterman's health"</strong>, would become the biggest story of the evening. 
            The Democrat was clearly hampered by a stroke he suffered days before Democratic primary voters chose him as their candidate - a <strong>episode</strong> brought on by a pre-existing heart condition.
        As the debate progressed, bingo cards were left unfilled.</em>
        The crowd was largely hushed, save for a few groans, and the biggest cheer came at the end, when Mr Fetterman - who once was mayor of a nearby town - said the Pittsburgh Steelers were his favourite American football team.</p>
        
        <p>Supporters were left wondering how damaging his difficulty answering questions and responding to attacks from his Republican opponent, Mehmet Oz, might be.
        "It's a shame," one said. "The reality is just because he has this medical condition and it impacts his life does not mean he's not a smart person."
        <!--Last Paragraph-->
        <p>He added that he hoped voters would see past one night's performance and focus on the issues they care about and the fact that control of the US Senate, currently divided 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, is at stake in this race.</p>
